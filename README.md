# My Data Science master's final project

In this work we will study the architecture of spike neural networks (SNN), networks that are much more similar to biological ones than artificial neural networks (ANN), since they transmit information in the form of discontinuous impulses, as opposed to continuous impulses of the latter.
One of the advantages of SNNs compared to ANNs is that they require fewer calculations and therefore their energy consumption is lower, but there is a main problem with this type of architecture, and it is the fact that there is no standard training method. Specifically, we are going to focus on efficient training methods for training SNNs in dataset classification tasks such as MNIST. Some models are reaching the precision of current ANN methods and if SNNs are used with neuromorphic computers there would be greater energy savings.
